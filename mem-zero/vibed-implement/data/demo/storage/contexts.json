The Butcher's Daughter - A Jewish deli and market with multiple locations in NYC. They offer a variety of veggie burgers and sandwiches.\n2. Cafe Grumpy - A cozy cafe in the West Village serving creative vegetarian dishes like eggplant parmesan and grilled portobello mushroom burgers.\n3. Xi'an Famous Foods - A casual Chinese restaurant chain with several locations in NYC, offering a range of spicy lamb-free options like vegetable dumplings and noodles.\n\nPlease note that menu items may change seasonally or by location, so it's always a good idea to check the current offerings before visiting.\n\nI hope this helps!"
